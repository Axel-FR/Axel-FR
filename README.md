- ðŸ‘‹ Hey I'm @Axel-FR
- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying economics at the University.
- ðŸ†’ I embrace the current data movement. I believe operating cutting-edge data analysis could help building more efficient organizations. Delivering the best consumer experience, reducing merchandise stocks so warehouses size, avoiding waste in case of perishable goods, performing all kind of forecasts about the future and many more are amongst the problems tackled by the use of data.
