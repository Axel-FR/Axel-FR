- 👋 Hey I'm @Axel-FR
- 📚 I'm currently studying economics at the University.
- 🆒 I embrace the current data movement. I believe operating cutting-edge data analysis could help building more efficient organizations. Delivering the best consumer experience, reducing merchandise stocks so warehouses size, avoiding waste in case of perishable goods, performing all kind of forecasts about the future and many more are amongst the problems tackled by the use of data.
- ❗ I am looking for an internship in data analysis starting at the end of April 2023 and lasting up to 4 months. The minimum required by the uni is 6 weeks but I am willing to do more because in my opininon this is too short. This internship is defined as an "observing" one but I am eager to participate actively in the company's development by taking advantage of my skills.
